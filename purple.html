     <p>Pictured above is Sir William Henry Perkins, the creator of the first organic synthetic dye, called Mauveine, which was a shade of purple, allowing the general public to enjoy the color purple. Before his invention purple was a color worn primarily by the 0.01% of the 1%, meaning that even some emperors couldn't afford such a cost. THis expensiveness has made purple the color of royalty and beauty. How about we celebrate this georgeous color with our own list of best shades of purples!

     <p>Like I stated in the intro Mauviene is quite historic, it was a synthetic dye that allowed purple to be used by the common man. THe color is alright, but it is still good.
