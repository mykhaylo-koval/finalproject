      <p class="important">Greetings
      <p> Colors are an important part of the lives of people who can see them,so no wonder people have opinions on them! Some people have a favorite color,
      <p>some have least favorite colors. It is completely normal to to like or dislike colors, so in the name of having civil discussions about colors I made this website.
      <p>Personally I like some colors more or less depending on the situation, like black is a bad color on it's own, but when you color a car black it looks absolutely epic.
      <p>Here the crew on mykhaylo-koval.github.io/finalproject/ we value colors and the emotions they give off. Our editor and writers work tirelessly to bring you the content
      <p>you love.
